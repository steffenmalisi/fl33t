This is a sample application where I can prototype my ideas and play around with tech.
Because I want that to happen in a realistic use case, I will take a modern mobility scenario (take Sixt Rent, Share, Ride, Subscription as an example).

## The scenario
Users can browse the digital mobilty offer of a company called Flix. This mobility offer consist of car rental (Flix IT!), car sharing (Flix GO!) and car subscription (Flix ME!). Flix does not rule out the possibility to shortly bring new products to the market. They think about ride hailing or an taxi service.

Flix has several stations all over the world. They call them satellites. Multiple satellites in one geographical region make up an operational unit, which they call planets. A planet has a planet manager, who wants to have an overview of his satellites and the cars that are located there. This includes reports about the utilization rate. Further tasks of the planet manager are infleeting and defleeting vehicles based on the utilization rate of his fleet.

A planet is also the boundary for the fleet. Each planet has its own fleet, but vehicles can be interchanged between the satellites of this planet. This can be done by the planet manager. The whole fleet should be used across each individual offer (Flix IT!, Flix GO! and Flix ME!).

Flix managers want to get an overview of the utilization, number of drives and amount of earned money of each planet and in total.
